# OctoPrint
Intended as a web interface to monitor and control 3D printers remotely, OctoPrint can also be used to manage a printer-based mechnical testing machine using GCODE

## Why OctoPrint?
* Massive community of users and developers providing feedback and support
* Continous development
* Standard approach to interfacing hardware

## How to use OctoPrint for Mechanical Testing? (Installation Guide)
### 1. Install the latest version of Marlin on your 3D printer
Marlin is the FIRMWARE for RepRap type printers. For now, this project will only cover/support this type of printers. Most of RepRap printers use an Arduino and a RAMPS 1.4 shield for machine control.
